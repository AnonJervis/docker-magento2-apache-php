This is a fork of fballiano's original docker-magento2-apache-php that includes "sockets" built within his DockerFile. Replace his apache image with this in docker-compose.yml if you receive a php socket error during initial installation.

For further info, please visit fballiano's page: https://github.com/fballiano/docker-magento2
All documentations are there.

All credit goes to fballiano for creating these amazing docker images.
